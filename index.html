    <h2>"I received a job offer but I need to move" — Starting a new life again...</h2>
    <p>Moving abroad can be exciting, but it also comes with unique personal and emotional challenges. Common challenges faced by expats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Loss of identity:</strong> Questioning one’s sense of purpose or professional direction, especially when personal or career goals are disrupted by relocation</li>
      <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Struggling to build meaningful connections in unfamiliar social or cultural settings</li>
      <li><strong>Culture shock:</strong> Navigating different customs, communication styles, and everyday expectations that may feel overwhelming or disorienting</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional stress:</strong> Experiencing anxiety, sadness, or emotional fatigue due to displacement and the pressures of adaptation</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of support:</strong> Being far from trusted networks of friends, mentors, or extended family</li>
      <li><strong>Career disruption:</strong> Pausing or changing careers due to relocation, visa limitations, or market constraints</li>
      <li><strong>Parenting and family adjustment:</strong> Helping children adapt to new schools and routines, or balancing family dynamics under stress</li>
      <li><strong>Visa and legal limitations:</strong> Facing restrictions on employment, healthcare, or stability due to bureaucratic hurdles</li>
      <li><strong>Relationship and connection strain:</strong> Managing long-distance relationships, evolving friendships, or partnership stress during transition</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of belonging:</strong> Feeling “in-between” cultures, struggling to feel rooted either in the host country or the one left behind</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Galina, a personal transformation specialist dedicated to helping expats rediscover their purpose, cultivate meaningful connection, and build lasting confidence abroad. Whether you’re navigating a new culture or seeking a deeper sense of fulfilment, I offer guidance rooted in lived experience — not theory.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve reinvented my life across London, Milan, Lugano, and Madrid — and yes, back to London more than once — through many chapters of who I’ve been: a single woman and a partner, a professional, a housewife, an entrepreneur, a wife, and a mother. I hold a Master’s degree in Finance and Accounting, and my career has spanned the finance and maritime industries, among others. I’ve managed complex projects, built a home, and speak four languages, including English, Russian, and Italian.</p>
        <p>I’m also someone who seeks challenge and adventure — I skydive, I scuba dive, and I never stop learning. What’s remained constant is my drive to evolve, to stay curious, and to meet life abroad not just with endurance — but with intention.</p>
        <p>I know how disorienting and emotionally complex it can be to start over in a new country. I’ve lived it, and now I help others move through it with clarity, purpose, and confidence.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to navigate it alone. This journey can become your most powerful transformation.</p>
